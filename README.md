# ![Flutter RealWorld Example App](flutter_realworld.png)

> ### [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

* Using [Flutter-ReduRx](https://github.com/leocavalcante/Flutter-ReduRx/) for managing State
* Using [flutter_i18n](https://github.com/long1eu/flutter_i18n) for i18n
  * English and **Chinese** Locale are supported!
* Infinite ListView inspired by [MARCIN SZAŁEK](https://marcinszalek.pl/flutter/infinite-dynamic-listview/). Good job, dude!
